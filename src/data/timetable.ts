      abstract: "As an elective course in the liberal arts and sciences program,\n Kyoto University has held a Python programming course since 2018.\n For this course, we developed a textbook in 2019, and continuously revised\n it. We also made the 2019 and the 2021 editions open to the public\n with the Creative Commons license CC-BY-NC-ND. We obtained various opinions\n that they are good learning material, and\n up to September 2023, we observed more than 1 million downloads.\n In this talk, the speaker explains why we developed a textbook by\n ourselves instead of using already published ones,\n and points in the design of it considering self-learning by university\n students\n as a novice in programming, and to meet a course goal that the learner\n can design, code, and test small Python programs by themselves.",

Over the last 10 years from a beginner engineer to today community organizing has shaped the way not only I connect to the language and community but has fundamentally altered my outlook on career development. Together we shall explore some of these lessons learned and reflect on how we can do more, do better.",
